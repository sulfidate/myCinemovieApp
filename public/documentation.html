				<h2>Context</h2>
				<p>It’s no longer enough for a JavaScript developer to be skilled in frontend development alone. It’s become essential that you be able to interface with (as you did in Achievement 1) and even create your own APIs. For this reason, throughout this Achievement, you’ll create a REST API for an application called “myFlix” that interacts with a database that stores data about different movies.
					In the next Achievement, you’ll build the client-side component of this same application using REACT. By the end of Achievement 3, you’ll have a complete web application (client-side and server-side) built using full-stack JavaScript technologies that you can showcase in your portfolio. The project will demonstrate your mastery of full-stack JavaScript development, including APIs, web server frameworks, databases, business logic, authentication, data security, and more. The complete tech stack you’ll master is known as the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack.
					Note that it’s not a requirement that you name your application “myFlix.” You’re also free to decide which movies you wish to include in your project. For example, you may want to build a movie application specifically for period or superhero movies, or a more diverse application with a wider user base. It’s up to you!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="the5ws">
				<h2>The 5 Ws</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Who—Your immediate users will be frontend developers who’ll work on the client-side for the application based on what’s been documented on the server-side (in this case, this developer is also you!). You should also consider the users of the myFlix application. These will be movie enthusiasts who enjoy reading information about different movies.</li>
					<li>What—The complete server-side of your web application, including the server, business logic, and business layers of the application. It will consist of a well-designed REST API and architected database built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that data in a non-relational way.</li>
					<li>When—Whenever users of myFlix are interacting with the application, the server-side of the application will be in use, processing their requests and performing operations against the data in the database. These users will be able to use the myFlix application whenever they like to read information about different movies or update their user information, for instance, their list of “Favorite Movies.”</li>
					<li>Where—The application will be hosted online. The myFlix application itself is responsive and can therefore be used anywhere and on any device, giving all users the same experience.</li>
					<li>Why—Movie enthusiasts want to be able to access information about different movies, directors, and genres. The server-side of the myFlix application will ensure they have access to this information, that their requests can be processed, and that all necessary data can be stored.</li>
